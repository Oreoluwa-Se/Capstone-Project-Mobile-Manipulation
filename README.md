# Capstone-Project-Mobile-Manipulation
* This repo is for the Capstone project from the [Mordern Robotics: Mechanics, Planning, and Control Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/modernrobotics) on coursera.
* The goal is to [move and plan]() the trajectory for the end-effector on a 5R robot arm articulated on a four mecanum wheels mobile base to move a cube from one to another specific location.
* Details of the capstone project can be found [here](http://hades.mech.northwestern.edu/index.php/Mobile_Manipulation_Capstone)
